                <p>Iâ€™m a problem solver at heart with a passion for technology, software development, and continuous learning. Based in Stockholm, I have a university background in Computer and Systems Sciences, with experience in building web applications using JavaScript, React, and Node.js for development purposes. I also work with Python and SQL for backend development and APIs, and I have experience with C# and Unity. I thrive in team environments, love collaborating, and always seek opportunities to grow. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, the gym, and watching movies with my girlfriend.
